/*Letâ€™s think of a ray as a function P(t)=A+tb
Here P is a 3D position along a line in 3D. 
A is the ray origin and b is the ray direction. The ray parameter t
is a real number (float in the code). Plug in a different t
and P(t) moves the point along the ray. Add in negative t
values and you can go anywhere on the 3D line. For positive t,
you get only the parts in front of A,and this is what is often called a half-line or a ray.
We can represent the idea of a ray as a class, and represent the function P(t)
as a function that we'll call ray::at(t)*/
